# Relevance

---

## Definition
- **Eng Version**
- Relevance is the dimension of data quality that refers to how well the data fits the specific goals and requirements of an analysis or campaign. Only relevant data contributes to the effectiveness of marketing efforts. Irrelevant data dilutes analysis and leads to wasted resources. For instance, demographic data that is irrelevant to a particular target audience could result in marketing messages that miss the mark.
